				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>Hello I'm Janesse, but I also go by Jan. I am currently a undergraduate
					student at UCSC majoring in Cognitive Science with a concentration on HCI/AI.
					I will be minoring in Global Information and Social Enterprises Studies in
					the upcoming fall which will make me one step closer to my goal to work internationally.
					My dream is to become a Product Designer that will create products that will better its
					users and the environment. Through taking this course, I will gain more coding skills that
					will allow me to implement new techniques into my designs!
				</p>

				<h2>Interests</h2>
				<p>I am a person that is extremely open to trying new things which led to me having way too
					many hobbies. In moments where I am in need for rejuvenation, I enjoy reading, playing my guitar,
					baking, gaming, and being out in nature. I also enjoy cooking and being active whether it be going
					on a
					hike, working out, or playing sports. I have always been an active learner so listening to TED Talks
					has
					been one of my unique interests. Music has always been a big part of my life, so I also enjoy
					finding
					new songs and artists in my free time :D</p>
