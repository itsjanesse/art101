			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Results</h2>
				<p>The results on this lab will appear on my Lab 10!</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Debugging</h2>
				<p>We were unable to get the output to appear on the file, but it was able to work after this.
					The way we fixed it was to define the output as a variable and use outputEl.innerHTML
					for the output to appear.</p>
